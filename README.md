# Battleship Project

For this project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, I used Test Driven Development techniques to build a battleship game in which the user plays against a not-so-intelligent computer opponent (so don't lose!). A link to the game can be found below.

### New Skills / Knowledge
- The benefits of pure functions in terms of testing
- Mocking
- Test Driven Development
